VERSION 2: 
-> NOTE: this article assume you know what a mathematical function is.
-> If not, here is a quick overview
-> But why? optimization, derivative, gradient, etc.
-> Can't we just write the function and the derivative?
-> Machine learning application.
-> Beside from the optimization with tensor inputs, we want to find the gradient automatically.

## Function
A function tells us how things turn into another. The things that get in/out of a function can be anything, including a function itself.

<AbstractFunction client:load />

This is a very abstract definition of a function. A more familiar form is the one that takes in a number and gives out, potentially, a different number.

<br />

$$
f(x) = x^2
$$

<FamiliarFunction client:load />

## Derivative
The concept of derivative is beautiful. I wrote another article purely dedicated to this which you can read it [here](/articles/derivative) (probably not exist yet).

<br />

All you need to know for this article are:

<br />

1. The output of a function **can be** different based on its input.
```
Linear Function
```
2. Derivative is used on a function to determine how the output would change with respect to its input.
```
Linear rate of change
```
3. The rate of change of a function **can** also varies depending on where you are on the function.
```
Curved function rate of change
```
4. To determine how something is changing, we need at least two data points to see the difference.
5. 
6. But, two points will give us the average rate of change which is not specific to a certain input.
```
average vs instantaneous rate of change
```
7. In derivative, we simply ask: "what if those two points are very close together?"

$$
\lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$
```
