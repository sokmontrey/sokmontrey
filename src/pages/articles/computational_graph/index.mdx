Computational Graph is a way to represent function in a computer program. The representation - Graph - can be used to optimize function evaluation. It is also open a door for finding the derivative or gradient of the function automatically.

Before we get any further, why do we want to "represent a function" in the first place? Can we just doing so using simple programming?

For example, the function $f(x) = sin(x^2 + 1)$, in JavaScript, can be written as 

```js
function f(x) {
    return Math.sin(x*x + 1);
}
```
or the arrow notation:
```js
const f = (x)=>Math.sin(x*x + 1);
```

And when we need its derivative, why don't we just... take its derivative?
The derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ would be $f'(x) = cos(x^2 + 1) \cdot 2x$.
In JavaScript would be:

```js
function df(x) {
    return Math.cos(x*x + 1) * 2 * x
}
```
