<h1 slot="toggler">Overview</h1>

## Function
A function tells us how things turn into another. The things that get in/out of a function can be anything, including a function itself.

<AbstractFunction client:load />

This is a very abstract definition of a function. A more familiar form is the one that takes in a number and gives out, potentially, a different number.

<br />

$$
f(x) = x^2
$$

<FamiliarFunction client:load />

## Derivative
The concept of derivative is beautiful. I wrote another article purely dedicated to this which you can read [here](/articles/derivative) (probably doesn't exist yet).

<br />

All you need to know for this article is that:

<br />

1. You want to know how a function $f(x)$ is changing at a specific input $a$.
2. To determine if or how something is changing, we need at least two data points to see the difference.

$$
\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} 
$$
$$
\textrm{(divided by the change in input b - a to find the rate)}
$$

3. But two is not one. We want to know the rate of change of the function at $a$ not an overall average, from $a$ to $b$.

<AverageNotInstant client:load />

$$
y = f(x) = x^2
$$

4. With derivative, we simply ask: "what if those two points were very close together?" Not on top of one another, but very close. Try moving the red dot closer to the blue one and see how the rate of change match up.

$$
\lim_{b\to a} \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
$$

With **Limit** we can make $b$ approach $a$. But remember, $b$ is not equal to $a$, they are very close. This is the derivative of $f(x)$ at $a$. 

<br />

Now, we can find the derivative of $f(x)$ at any point $x$. To do so, we increase $x$ by a small amount $h$ then divide the change in output by the change in input.

<div class="p-2 my-4 border border-[var(--pm-color)] border-dashed border-2 ">

$$
 \color{gray}{ \frac{\mathrm{d} f }{\mathrm{d} x} =} \; \color{teal}{ \lim_{h \to 0} } \color{orange}{ \frac{f(x+\color{teal}{h} \color{orange}{) - f(x)}} {\color{teal}{h}} }
$$

</div>

This is the **fundamental definition of derivative**. 

<br />

5. But we, a sane individual, would love to have a little abstraction. There are derivative rules on **elementary functions** (power, exponential, trig function, etc) that can solve any complex function as long as applied with **combinational derivative rules** (product, chain rule, etc).
