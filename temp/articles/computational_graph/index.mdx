# Overview
## Function

A function tells us how things turn into another. The things that get in/out of a function can be anything, including a function itself.

<AbstractFunction client:load />

This is a very abstract definition of a function. A more familiar form is the one that takes in a number and gives out, potentially, a different number.

$$
f(x) = x^2
$$

<FamiliarFunction client:load />

## Derivative
The concept of derivative is beautiful. I wrote another article purely dedicated to this which you can read [here](/articles/derivative) (probably doesn't exist yet).

All you need to know for this article is that:

1. We want to know how a function f changes at a specific input a.
2. To determine if or how something is changing, we need at least two data points to see the difference.

<Hover>

<span slot="toggler">
$$
\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} 
$$
</span>

Divide the change in output by the change in input to find the rate of change.

</Hover>

3. But two are not one. We want to know the rate of change of the function at $a$ not an overall average, from $a$ to $b$.

<AverageNotInstant client:load />

$$
y = f(x) = x^2
$$

4. With derivative, we simply ask: "what if those two points were very close together?" Not on top of one another, but very close. Try moving the red dot closer to the blue one and see how the rate of change match up.

$$
\lim_{b\to a} \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
$$

We can use **Limit** to make $b$ approach $a$. But remember, $b$ is not equal to $a$, they are very close. This is the derivative of $f(x)$ at $a$. Replace $a$ with any pointer $x$ we got the **fundamental definition of derivative**. 

<div class="p-2 my-4 border pm-color border-[var(--pm-color)] border-dashed ">

<Hover>

<span slot="toggler">

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d} f }{\mathrm{d} x} =\; \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)} {h}
$$

</span>

To find the derivative of $f(x)$ at any point $x$, we increase $x$ by a small amount $h$ then divide the change in output by the change in input.

</Hover>

</div>

5. This formula is used to derive simple rules on <Hover> 
    <span slot="toggler"> elementary functions </span>
    <ul> <li>$x^n$</li> <li>$e^x$</li> <li>$\sin$</li> <li>$\ln$</li> <li>...</li> </ul> 
</Hover>. Those rules then can be used to solve any advanced function using <Hover>
    <span slot="toggler">combinational rules</span>
    , derivative rules acting on combination of functions.
    <ul><li>$f(x) + g(x)$</li><li>$f(x) \times g(x)$</li><li>$f(g(x))$</li></ul>
</Hover>. The result is another function that can calculate the rate of change, precisely. 

<br />

# Why?

Let's make things clear before we continue. It is very easy to represent mathematical expression in a computer program. The function $f(x) = x^2$ can be written in [python](https://www.python.org/) as:
    
```python
def f(x):
    return x**2 # x square
```

And its derivative form with respect to $x$, <Hover> 
<span slot="toggler"> $\frac{d}{dx}f = 2x$</span> <br/><br/>
$x^2$ is in the form $x^n$. <br /> **Power rule**: $\frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1}$
</Hover>, can be written as: 

```python 
def df(x):
    return 2*x
```

So, [why](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/why) am I writing this article? why can't we just... write the code? Why do we need **computational graph**? And what is a graph anyway? 

Here is why, we simply do not want to figure out and write the derivative of any function by hand. It is now a computer's job.

# Computational Graph

Consider the function:

$$
f(x) = e^{5x + 3}
$$

It can look very intimidating. But it is just a series of operations. First, we multiply $x$ by $5$, then add $3$, and finally raise $e$ to the result.

Below, is how you might visualize the operations:

<StraightGraph client:load />

By the way, this is a graph, a computational graph. It is consisted of connected nodes, each representing a math operation. The edges are the flow of output from one operation to another.

Let's take a look at another function:

$$
{\color{white} g(x) = {\color{orange}\sin}^2{\color{orange}(x)} + 3{\color{orange} \sin(x)} }
$$

And here is its graph:

<NotStraightGraph client:load />

One thing to note here is that when creating computational graph, we need to avoid redundant nodes and operations. $\sin(x)$ is being used twice in the function.

And this should be enough for us to get started with the concept of automatic differentiation or auto diff. And we will go back and forth between these two.

# Differentiation

There are a few methods to find the derivative of a function. Auto diff is just one of them that work well in a computer program.

## Symbolic Differentiation
This is the method we might use when finding the derivative by hand.

For example, if we have the following function:

$$
f(x, y) = x^2 + \sin(x + y^2) 
$$

Its derivative with respect to $x$ is (hover over expression for explanations):

<div class='flex justify-center items-center '>

<Hover> 
<span slot="toggler" class='ac2-color'>
$$
\frac{\partial f} {\partial x} =
$$ 
</span>
The symbol $\partial$ denotes the partial derivative, the derivative of $f$ with respect to one of its **many** inputs.
</Hover>

<Hover>
<span slot="toggler" class='ac1-color'>
$$
\;\; 2x
$$
</span>
Power rule $\frac{d}{dx}x^2 = 2x$
</Hover>

<Hover>
<span slot="toggler" class='pm-color'>
$$
\; + \cos(x + y^2)
$$
</span>
Derivative of $\sin(x)$ is $\cos(x)$ <br />

$$
\Rightarrow \sin'(x + y^2) = \cos(x + y^2)
$$

(prime `'` is another notation for derivative)
</Hover>

<Hover>
<span slot="toggler" class='sd-color'>
$$
\;\; \cdot \;\; 1
$$
</span>
This is the result of **chain rule**. The previous sin rule is for $\sin(x)$ not $\sin(x + y^2)$. We can still use it on the function, but we must must multiple it with the derivative of the inner function. Derivative of $x + y^2$ with respect to $x$ is 1.
</Hover>

</div>

Since $f$ take in two inputs, we use the symbol $\partial$ to denote the partial derivative, the derivative of $f$ with respect to one of its many inputs.

This mean that we can also find the derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$:

<div class='flex justify-center items-center '>

$$
\frac{\partial f} {\partial y} = 
$$
<Hover>
<span slot="toggler" class='text-gray-500'>
$$
\; 0
$$
</span>
Power Rule: Derivative of $x^2$ with respect to $y$ is $0$. (x is a constant $\times y^0$)
</Hover>

<Hover>
<span slot="toggler" class='pm-color'>
$$
\; + \cos(x + y^2)
$$
</span>

- Trig Rule: Derivative of $\sin(\mathrm{inner\;function})$ is $\cos(\mathrm{inner\;function})$.
- Chain Rule: Multiply with the derivative of the inner function with respect to y.

</Hover>

<Hover>
<span slot="toggler" class='sd-color'>
$$
\;\; \cdot \;\; 2y
$$
</span>
Power rule: Derivative of $x + y^2$ with respect to $y$ is $2y$. ($x$ is a constant $\times y^2$)
</Hover>

</div>

Now, here is the problem. Each derivative is another function. If the original function has a lot of parameters (input), we would also have a lot of new function for each inputs. Of course there are ways to optimize this. The **main problem** of this method is that it could leads to a very complicated function very quickly.

As a homework, try it out on function that require **product rules**.

## Numerical Differentiation

Another method use the **fundamental definition of derivative**. Pull up the formula, plug in your desire input, plug in a very small number, and you got your answer. This is **numerical differentiation**.

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d} f }{\mathrm{d} x} =\; \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)} {h}
$$

Here is how you might implement it in python:

```python
def df(f, x, h=1e-5):
    return (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h
```

It's simple, but let's not waste our time to it. $h$ need to be an incredibly small number, and computer are very bad with that. But please don't just take my word for it. Try out the code and compare them with the infinitely accurate symbolic method. There are many other problems with this method. If you are interested in the topic enough, please, please, please look for other detailed explainations.

## Automatic Differentiation

There are two types of auto diff: **forward mode** and **reverse mode**. We will talk about reverse mode because it feels more natural to me. But they all have pros and cons, mostly depending on the ratio between number of input and number of output of the function. With that, we are ready to start. 

The most important thing for auto diff is idea of **Chain Rule**. Any function that can be represented as a computational graph is differentiable using the chain rule. Let's checkout a few examples.

### Example 1

Consider the function $f(x) = a(x)b(x)$. We have function $a$ and $b$, both take in $x$, multiplied together to get $f$. The graph should look something like this:
